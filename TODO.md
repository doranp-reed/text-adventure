# Modifications
## main
change how `show-help` works? (generalize)
generalize `match-case` to more commands? is it feasible/reasonable to have a "commands list?"
refactor `command` to split on spaces
change how `command-success` works? seems kind of unintuitive to me

# Ideas
map, or some way of tracking history/not getting lost
