<!--
# starter code modification
added type hinting, good-practice spacing between functions
extracted `clear()` function to its own file

# improved help menu
easier to add to

# command abbreviations/modifications
some of these are just for clarity
`inventory` -> `inv`
`pickup` -> `take`
`attack` -> `fight`
changing functionality so everything is accessible by a single word (e.g. monsters by their name, items have 1 word)
